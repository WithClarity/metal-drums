# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## 🚀 Creating a New GitHub Repository

Follow these steps to create and push your Metal Drums project to GitHub:

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `metal-drums` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `Professional web drum machine with real samples, advanced performance controls, and musical notation`
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended for portfolio) or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/metal-drums.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload
1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files uploaded
3. The README.md will display automatically on the repository homepage

## 🔧 Alternative: Using GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)
```bash
# Create repository and push in one command
gh repo create metal-drums --public --description "Professional web drum machine with real samples and advanced performance controls" --push
```

## 📝 Next Steps After Upload

### Update README with Correct URLs
Once uploaded, update these placeholders in README.md:
- Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username
- Update any demo links if you deploy the app

### Consider Adding a License
Add a LICENSE file if you want to specify how others can use your code:
```bash
# Add MIT License (example)
curl -o LICENSE https://raw.githubusercontent.com/licenses/license-templates/master/templates/mit.txt
```

### Set Up GitHub Pages (Optional)
To host your app on GitHub Pages:
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: main
4. Folder: / (root)
5. GitHub will build and deploy automatically

## 🎯 Repository Features to Enable

After uploading, consider enabling these GitHub features:

### Issues and Projects
- Enable Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- Create a project board for tracking development

### Releases
- Create releases for major versions
- Tag releases with semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)

### Security
- Enable Dependabot for automatic dependency updates
- Add security advisories if needed
