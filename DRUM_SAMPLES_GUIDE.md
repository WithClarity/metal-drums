### Option 3: Freesound.org (Individual Samples)

3. Download individual samples

5. Rename and copy to `public/audio/samples/`

## File Requirements
- **Format**: WAV (preferred) or MP3
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1kHz or 48kHz
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit minimum, 24-bit preferred
- **Size**: Keep under 5MB per file for web loading
- **Names**: Must be exactly: `kick.wav`, `snare.wav`, `hihat.wav`, `tom.wav`, `crash.wav`, `ride.wav`

## Metal/Metalcore Recommendations
For the best metal sounds, look for:
- **Kick**: Punchy, deep kicks with good attack
- **Snare**: Crisp, cutting snares with good crack
- **Hi-hat**: Tight, metallic closed hi-hats
- **Tom**: Resonant floor or rack toms
- **Crash**: Bright, explosive crashes
- **Ride**: Clear bell tone with good sustain

## After Installing Samples
1. Restart the development server (`npm run dev`)
2. Refresh your browser
3. Test the drum pads - you should hear real drums!
4. Adjust volume in the app if needed

## Troubleshooting
- Check browser console for loading errors
- Ensure file names match exactly
